Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:
    ResNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg (Siberian_husky_02.jpg.jpg) as "eskimo dog, husky".

    VGG: Classified Dog_01.jpg (Siberian_husky_02.jpg.jpg) as "eskimo dog, husky".

    AlexNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg (Siberian_husky_02.jpg.jpg) as "malamute, malemute, alaskan malamute".

    The classifications for Dog_01.jpg are not the same across all three models. AlexNet classified it differently compared to ResNet and VGG. 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
    ResNet:
        Dog_01.jpg (Siberian_husky_02.jpg.jpg): "eskimo dog, husky".
        Dog_02.jpg (Siberian_husky_01.jpg.jpg): "eskimo dog, husky".
    VGG:
        Dog_01.jpg (Siberian_husky_02.jpg.jpg): "eskimo dog, husky".
        Dog_02.jpg (Siberian_husky_01.jpg.jpg): "eskimo dog, husky".
    AlexNet:
        Dog_01.jpg (Siberian_husky_02.jpg.jpg): "malamute, malemute, alaskan malamute".
        Dog_02.jpg (Siberian_husky_01.jpg.jpg): "eskimo dog, husky".

    ResNet and VGG classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed ("eskimo dog, husky"). However, AlexNet classified them differently.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:
    Animal_Name_01.jpg (Grizzly_bear_01.jpg.jpg):
        ResNet: Classified as "brown bear, bruin, ursus arctos".
        VGG: Classified as "brown bear, bruin, ursus arctos".
        AlexNet: Classified as "brown bear, bruin, ursus arctos".

    Object_Name_01.jpg (Table_lamp_01.jpg.jpg):
        ResNet: Classified as "table lamp".
        VGG: Classified as "table lamp".
        AlexNet: Classified as "table lamp".

    All three model architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as not being dogs. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
    VGG and ResNet  architectures did equally well in all aspect given questions 1. - 3.

Reason:

    While VGG had the same performance as ResNet in terms of correct and incorrect classifications, AlexNet misclassified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as different breeds, indicating less reliability.
    
    Nevertheless, given that the VGG model ran in 0:59:46, which is slightly less than the ResNet runtime of 0:59:51, I feel that the VGG architecture is the best model.
